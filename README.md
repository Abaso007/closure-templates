Closure Templates
=================

Closure Templates are a client- and server-side templating system that helps
you dynamically build reusable HTML and UI elements. They are easy to learn
and customizable to fit your application's needs. Closure Templates support
JavaScript and Java and use a data model and expression syntax that works for
either language. You can also use the built-in message support to easily
localize your applications.
